# Overview

## 1.2.0

### New Features

* mongoid/mongoid\#2210 Added `Session#disconnect` which will disconnect all
  nodes in the cluster from their respective database servers. Useful for cases
  where a large number of database connections are being created on separate
  threads and need to be explicitly closed after their work is completed.

* \#33 Added `Session#databases` and `Session#database_names` as a convenience
  for getting all database information for the server.

        session = Moped::Session.new([ "localhost:27017" ])
        session.database_names #=> [ "moped_test" ]
        session.databases #=> { "databases" => [{ "name" => "moped_test" }]}
